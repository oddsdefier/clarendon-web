# Performance Improvements for NewsAndEventsSection Component

## 1. Memoization

### React.memo()

-  Applied to the entire `NewsAndEventsSection` component and the `NewsCard` sub-component.
-  Prevents unnecessary re-renders when props or state haven't changed.
-  Particularly useful for optimizing the rendering of individual news items.

### useMemo()

-  Used for `bgImgUrl` to memoize the randomly selected background image URL.
-  Ensures the background image is only calculated once and remains consistent across re-renders.
-  Moved inside the component to comply with React Hook rules.

## 2. State Management Optimization

-  Extracted `NewsCard` as a separate component to reduce prop drilling and improve render efficiency.
-  Used `useCallback()` for `updateSlidesPerView` to prevent recreation on every render.

## 3. Event Listener Optimization

-  Wrapped `updateSlidesPerView` in `requestAnimationFrame()` for the resize event.
-  Improves performance during window resizing by reducing the frequency of updates.

## 4. Image Loading Optimization

-  Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to images.
-  Defers loading of off-screen images until they're needed, improving initial load time.

## 5. Component Structure Improvements

-  Kept the Carousel component as-is, assuming it's already internally optimized.
-  Reduced prop drilling by creating a separate `NewsCard` component.

## Additional Considerations

-  Virtualization could be implemented for handling a large number of news items.
-  Next.js Image component could be used for better image optimization if applicable.
-  Pagination or infinite scrolling could be considered for large datasets.

## Key Takeaways

1. These optimizations are most effective with larger datasets or on slower devices.
2. For smaller applications, some optimizations might be premature.
3. Always measure performance before and after optimizations to ensure they're beneficial.
4. React Hooks must be used within functional components or custom Hooks, not at the top level.
